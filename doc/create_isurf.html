<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>This command converts all currently defined explicit surface elements
to implicit surface elements.  One motivation for this operation is
that implicit surfaces can be ablated over time via the <A HREF = "fix_ablate.html">fix
ablate</A> command.  See the <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_13">How to
6.13</A> section of the manual for an
explantion of explicit versus implicit surfaces.
</P>
<P>Explicit surface elements are triangles in 3d or line segments in 2d.
They are enumerated in a file, read by the <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A>
command.  Implicit surface elements are also triangles or line
segments.  However each element is contained within a single grid
cell.
</P>
<P>A related command which defines implicit surfaces is the
<A HREF = "read_isurf">read_isurf</A> command which reads a file of corner point
values defined on a 2d or 3d grid, which is mapped to (a portion of)
the SPARTA grid.  It then calculates appropriate implicit line
segments or triangles within each grid cell based on its 4 or 8 corner
points.  See the <A HREF = "read_isurf">read_isurf</A> command for details.
</P>
<P>This command derives the 2d or 3d grid of corner point values from the set 
of explicit surface elements, rather then reading them from a file.  It
then proceeds similarly to the <A HREF = "read_isurf">read_isurf</A> command where 
implicit line segments or triangles within each grid cell are calculated
from the 4 or 8 corner points.  When the process is complete, all
explicit surfaces are removed by this command.  This is because SPARTA
does not currently allow both implicit and explicit surfaces to simulataneously
exist.  The <A HREF = "read_isurf">read_isurf</A> doc page has additional information 
about using implicit surfaces in a simulation, which also apply to this
command.
</P>
<P>IMPORTANT NOTE: As for the <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command, all
implicit triangles (line segments in 2d) created within the same grid
cell are assigned the same surface ID, which is the grid cell ID.
</P>
<HR>

<P>Here are 3 pairs of images for a 2D circle, a 3D idealized bumpy
surface, and a 3D cone.  For each pair, the image on the left is the
explicit surface composed of line segments or triangles.  The image on
the right is the corresponding implicit surfaces created by this
command.  Click on each image for a larger version:

<HR>

<P>The specified <I>group-ID</I> must be the name of a grid cell group, as
defined by the <A HREF = "group.html">group grid</A> command, which contains a set
of grid cells, all of which are the same size and comprise a
contiguous 3d array with a specified extent <I>Nx</I> by <I>Ny</I> by <I>Nz</I>.  For
2d simulations, <I>Nz</I> must be specified as 1, and the group must
comprise a 2d array of cells that is <I>Nx</I> by <I>Ny</I>.  These are the grid
cells within which implicit surfaces will be created.  It is assumed that
the user correctly identifies the region within which contains all explicit
surfaces.  
</P>
<P>NOTE: If the user defines a region which omits a portion of the explicit surface,
the command will proceed but may create an implicit surface unlike the 
explicit surface.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>ablateID</I> is the fix ID of a <A HREF = "fix_ablate.html">fix
ablate</A> command which has been previously specified in
the input script.  It will store the grid corner point values for each
grid cell.  It also has the code logic for converting grid corner
point values to surface elements (line segments or triangles) and also
optionally allows for the surface to be ablated during a simulation due
to particles colliding with the surface elements.
</P>
<P>As with the "read_isurf" command, the algorithm to create the implicit
surfaces requires a threshold value as input, which is the <I>thresh</I>
value.  For corner point values that bracket the threshold, it
determines precisely where in the grid cell the vertices of the
inferred implicit surface elements will be.
</P>
<P>The threshold must be specified as a floating point value such that 0
< thresh < 255.
</P>
<P>The specified <I>mode</I> can be either <I>inout</I> or <I>ave</I>. The <I>inout</I> mode
sets corner point values to zero if they are outside the volume or
area enclosed by the explicit surfaces.  Conversely it sets corner point
values to 255 if they are inside the volume or area. If the explicit surface
exactly intersects a grid cell corner, the code interprets that corner as outside
the surface. 
</P>
<P>The <I>ave</I> mode is meant to more precisely capture the explicit surfaces.
As with <I>inout</I> mode, corner point values outside the surface are set
to zero.  For corner points which are inside the surface, the intersection 
between each cell edge touching the corner point and the
explicit surfaces are recorded. In 2D, there are at most 4 intersections;
in 3D, there are at most 6 intersections.  In the case more than one line 
or triangle intersects a given cell edge, only the surface whose intersection 
is closer to the corner point is considered.  Given the coordinates af 
each intersection, since the outside corner point values are always zero, 
the inside corner point value can be extrapolated.  Where multiple intersections
are found around a corner point,  the final inside corner point values is 
taken as the average of all the inside corner point values corresponding 
to each intersection.
</P>
<P>Note that no matter which mode is used, implicit surfaces are an
approximation to the original explicit surfaces.  In particular:
</P>
<UL><LI>The set of implicit surfaces cannot fully resolve features smaller
than the size of the uniform grid cells used to overlay the
triangulated object.  Furthermore, both the <I>inout</I> and <I>ave</I> mode do not
conserve the normal of each surface element, so an exact match
is generally not possible.  In general, shrinking the grid cell size
(more grid cells) will give a better match to the explicit surface
elements.  

<LI>If two adjoining explicit surfaces have different normal vectors, then
there is effectively a discontinuous "kink" in the surface,
represented by a kink edge (3d) or kink points (2d or 3d).  If a kink
edge or kink point is inside a grid cell, the implicit surface
elements generated for that grid cell do not "see" the kink.  This is
because the 4 or 8 corner point values of a cell fully determine the
implicit surfaces generated within that cell, and they are derived
from the intersection of explicit surfaces with the faces of the grid
cell. 
</UL>
<HR>

<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>Explicit and implicit surfaces cannot be mixed in the same simulation.
Thus, all explicit surfaces from all surface groups are converted into
implicit surfaces, and no additional explicit surfaces can be added
after this command is used.
</P>
<P>This command can only be used after the simulation box is defined by
the <A HREF = "create_box.html">create_box</A> command, and after a grid has been
created by the <A HREF = "create_grid.html">create_grid</A> command.  Additionally,
explicit surfaces must already be defined by the <A HREF = "read_surf">read_surf</A>
command.  Simulations with implicit surfaces cannot perform grid
adaptation.
</P>
<P>The <A HREF = "global.html">global surfs explicit/distributed</A> command must be
used before using the <A HREF = "read_surf.html">read_surf</A> command which defined
the explicit surfaces.  This is because implicit surfaces are always
distributed.
</P>
<P>If particles already exist in the simulation along with the explicit
surfaces, they should always end up outside the implicit surfaces (in
the flow volume) as well.  Following the explicit to implicit surface
conversion, any particles which were previously outside but now inside
the surface are immediately deleted.
