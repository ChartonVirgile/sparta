CHANGES-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stats.cpp:
  new_time revised in compute_tpcpu()

grid.h:
  added dt to ChildCell class
  added dtg to Grid class                        (located here instead of update.h for restart)
  added global time (time_global) to Grid class  (located here instead of update.h for restart)

grid.cpp:
  added cell dt to restarts (size_restart(), pack_restart(), unpack_restart())
  added grid dtg and time_global to write_restart() and read_restart()
  initialized time_global to zero in Grid constructor
  add global time increment at top of timestep loop in Update::run()

particle.h:
  added particle time to OnePart class
  added particle time to OnePartRestart class

particle.cpp:
  added particle time copy to pack_restart() functions

read_restart.cpp
  began modifying create_child_cells()


QUESTIONS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

check into reset_timestep(), compute_dt()

what is the impact of variable timestepping on computes and fixes?









TODO-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

search for all places where dt in class Update is used.  Might be better to eliminate dtg eventually
  and have dt store the global timestep. (but using dtg during development will help indicate what
  is new/old code for variable time-stepping).
remove dt from update.h (and access from grid class)

finish logic added to ReadRestart::create_child_cells for cell dt (put dt in add_child_cell() argument list?)
  Could add optional argument for cell dt when calling create_child_cells for restart case.   obviously would
  need to compute it otherwise, e.g., during grid construction (read_grid.cpp).  But what about AMR? adopt global
  time step as cell dt until mean collision time and mean traversal time are available? or use some fraction of
  the parent cell dt?
