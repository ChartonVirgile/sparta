CHANGES-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

stats.cpp:
  new_time revised in compute_tpcpu()

grid.h:
added dt_desired to ChildCell class
  added time to ChildCell class                  (this is the cell time)
  added dt_global to Grid class                  (located here instead of update.h for restart)
  added global time (time_global) to Grid class  (located here instead of update.h for restart)
  added get_particle_time function (constructed from global time and cell desired dt)
  added variable_adaptive_time boolean

grid.cpp:
  added cell dt_desired and time (cell) to restarts (size_restart(), pack_restart(), unpack_restart())
  added grid dt_global and time_global to write_restart() and read_restart()
  initialized time_global to zero in Grid constructor
  add global time increment at top of timestep loop in Update::run()
  added get_particle_time function (constructed from global time and cell desired dt)
  set cell time to be time_global in add_child_cell

particle.h:
  added particle time to OnePart class
  added particle time to OnePartRestart class
  modified add_particle function to include particle_time in argument list

particle.cpp:
  added particle time copy to pack_restart() functions
  modified add_particle function to include particle_time in argument list


* switched to overloaded add_particle() with particle_time
  create_particles.cpp
  fix_emit_surf.cpp
  collide_vss.cpp
  fix_emit_face_file.cpp
  fix_emit_face.cpp
  read_particles.cpp
  read_restart.cpp

  surf_react_prob.cpp
  surf_react_global.cpp
    where add_particle appears, the new particle time was copied from the existing "i" particle

  surf_react_adsorb.cpp
    where add_particle appears with "i" particle data, the new particle time was copied from the existing "i" particle.
    However, there are some add_particle calls that I don't understand (where pcell is passed in through the argument list
    but is not set previously).

read_restart.cpp
  began modifying create_child_cells()

input.[h,cpp]
  added parsing of variable "timestep_va", the variable-adaptive starting timestep

update.cpp
  added logic to skip particle move if not sufficiently lagging the global time

collide.cpp
  added variable_adaptive_time logic to collisions_one()


QUESTIONS-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

check into reset_timestep(), compute_dt()

what is the impact of variable timestepping on computes and fixes?

In update.cpp does particle ever move less than full dt?????? ------> ANSWER: at end of loop advecting
  all particles, particles[i].dtremain = 0.  Therefore, the particle time does not need to be adjusted
  by the time remaining in the move interval as in ds2v.f90.

In ds2v.f90, why does the move stop (with particle time adjusted accordingly) if the time remaining
in the move is less than 0.1*characteristic_cell_time (or in SPARTA language, 0.1*dt_desired for the cell).






TODO-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

search for all places where dt in class Update is used.  Might be better to eliminate dt_global eventually
  and have dt store the global timestep. (but using dt_global during development will help indicate what
  is new/old code for variable time-stepping).
remove dt from update.h (and access either dt or dt_global from grid class)

finish logic added to ReadRestart::create_child_cells for cell dt (put dt in add_child_cell() argument list?)
  Could add optional argument for cell dt when calling create_child_cells for restart case.   obviously would
  need to compute it otherwise, e.g., during grid construction (read_grid.cpp).  But what about AMR? adopt global
  time step as cell dt until mean collision time and mean traversal time are available? or use some fraction of
  the parent cell dt?

need to make sure that cell dt_desired is set before particles are created initially

check on add_particle() without arguments and ramifications with variable, adaptive time-stepping.

how should particle times be set in the add_particle() calls in surf_react_adsorb.cpp (where
pcell is also passed in but not set)?  Look at dtremain as well.  Note that the AddParticle class
does not have time data.

STOPPED HERE: in collide.cpp added variable_adaptive_time logic in collisions_one().  need to figure out how 
to use dtc in actual collision functions called from collisions_one() and collisions_one_ambipolar(), e.g.,
 in collide_vss.cpp in CollideVSS::attempt_collision(), where dt is used.  Should we just pass in dtc in the
 attempt_collision() argument list?

 don't forget to modify collisions_one_ambipolar.
